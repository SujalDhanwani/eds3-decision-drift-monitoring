# ED³S – Enterprise Decision Drift Detection System

This project is a prototype to understand how business decisions made by
machine learning models can silently change over time.

Initial focus:
- Loan approval decisions
- Monitoring approval rate changes
- Understanding why decisions drift

This repository is built step by step to learn system design and ML monitoring.
